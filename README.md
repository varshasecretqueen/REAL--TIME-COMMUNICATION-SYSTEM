* The project was initiated to address the communication challenges faced by this community and to help bridgethe gap in accessibility.
The main challenge was creating a system that could accurately translate sign language into spoken language and vice versa in real-time.
* This involved training the model on large datasets of sign language and spoken language to ensure accurate translation.
* Collected and annotated a diverse dataset of sign language and spoken language to train the AI model.Once the model was trained and
  tested it extensively.
* Successfully Developed a translating sign language to spoken language and vice versa in real-time.
